# Expense-Analysis

The goal of this project was to find some interesting patterns about alcohol expenses in Italy. 
I tried to improve my data analysis skills using the R language.
Since it was a university project, I had to write in my native language - Polish.

Libraries:
dplyr
tidyr
ggplot2
knitr

Unfortunately I cannot upload the csv file due to too big size (HBS Microdati Anno 2011)
